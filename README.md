assuming it is a hotel . In this hotel, there are ten rooms available. Using PC, the Receptionist enters the room number, Password, and room status. Then we have three conditions when we check the room status: • If room status is "0", so that means "CheckenIn”, and the door is opened by a password. • Else if room status is "1", so that means "Checking Out", and the door is always locked. • Else if room status is "2", so that means "Room cleaning", and the door is always unlocked.

In my code Door's lock is substituted with LEDs. led become green to indicate the door should be opened or become red to indicate the door should be closed.
